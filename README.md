# CSS variables and JS

This the third project of the Javascript30 challenge.

This JavaScript mini-project demonstrates the dynamic manipulation of CSS variables using DOM manipulation and event handling. Through the interface's sliders and color picker, users can adjust spacing, blur, and color, instantly updating the styling of the displayed image in real-time.

## Concepts utilised in building this project -

1) DOM Manipulation:

Utilizing document.querySelectorAll() to access multiple elements in the DOM.

2) Dataset:

Accessing custom data attributes of HTML elements using the dataset property.

3) DocumentElement:

Modifying CSS properties on the root element (document.documentElement) using document.documentElement.style.setProperty().

4) SetProperty:

Setting CSS properties dynamically using setProperty().

5) Event Handling:

Adding event listeners to DOM elements using addEventListener().
Listening for the change event, which fires when the value of an input element is changed.
Listening for the mousemove event, which fires when the mouse pointer is moved over an element.
